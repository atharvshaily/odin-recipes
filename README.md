Aim: THe aim of my current project is to create a simple website, that describes a recipe. IT won't be 'pretty' as such, since formatting and all that stuff is in CSS, but it will be 
functional!
Skills: On succesful completion of this website, I will demonstrate a basic knowledge of html commands, elements etc. It  will be the first step towards learning HTML!
